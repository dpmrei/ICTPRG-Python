Task 0.a
    1.  Iterate through every number within the range of 0 - 100 (0-101 in code)
    2.  Using modulo , divide each number by 10 and check if there are any remainders.
    3.  If there are no remainders, then the number is 0 or divisible by 10, so pass
    4.  Otherwise, print the number if not divisible by 10

Task 0.b
    1.  Iterate through every number within the range of 0 - 100 (0-101 in code)
    2.  Convert each number to string format and check if the number '3' is found in
        each iteration
    3.  If number '3' is found, then pass to next iteration
